# Rigidbody

In real-world physics, a rigid body is any physical body that does not deform or change shape under physics forces. The distance between any two given points of a rigid body remains constant in time, regardless of external forces exerted on it. To simulate physics-based behavior such as movement, collision, and joints, you need to configure items in your scene as rigid bodies.
