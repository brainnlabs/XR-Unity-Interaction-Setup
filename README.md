# Camera

- Add **OVRCameraRig** prefab
- Go to the *Inspector* -> *OVR Manager (Script)* -> *Tracking* -> *Tracking Origin Type =* ***Floor Level***
- Go to the *Inspector* -> *OVR Manager (Script)* -> *Quest Features* -> *Hand Tracking Support =* ***Controllers and Hands***

# Rigidbody

In real-world physics, a rigid body is any physical body that does not deform or change shape under physics forces. The distance between any two given points of a rigid body remains constant in time, regardless of external forces exerted on it. To simulate physics-based behavior such as movement, collision, and joints, you need to configure items in your scene as rigid bodies.

 Rigidbody component provides a physics-based way to control the movement and position of a GameObject. Instead of the Transform properties, you can use simulated physics forces and torque to move the GameObject, and let the physics engine
 calculate the results.

 if a GameObject has a Rigidbody, you should use the Rigidbody properties to move the GameObject, instead of the Transform properties. The Rigidbody properties apply forces and torque from the physics system, which change the GameObjectâ€™s Transform.

Unity handles physics-based movement globally, not locally. When a GameObject with a Rigidbody moves via physics-based movement, it moves independently of any parent or child GameObject. A child GameObject that has a Rigidbody still uses its parent GameObject to define its local position for initialization, but Unity calculates its physics-based movement in global space.

To control a Rigidbody via script, the primary classes are **AddForce** (to add forces to a GameObject) and **AddTorque** (to apply torque to a GameObject).
